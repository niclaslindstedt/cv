## Abstract

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on any kind of device (including desktops, laptops, kiosks, and mobile devices). Following these guidelines will also often make web content more usable to users in general.

WCAG 2.2 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.

WCAG 2.2 extends [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) \[[WCAG21](#bib-wcag21 "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1")\], which was published as a W3C Recommendation June 2018. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 also conforms to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1. The WG intends that for policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1, WCAG 2.2 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The publication of WCAG 2.2 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1. While WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 remain W3C Recommendations, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.2 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating web accessibility policies.

## Introduction

*This section is non-normative.*

### Background on WCAG 2

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.

WCAG 2.2 is developed through the [W3C process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/) in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.2 builds on WCAG 2.0 \[[WCAG20](#bib-wcag20 "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0")\] and WCAG 2.1 \[[WCAG21](#bib-wcag21 "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1")\], which in turn built on WCAG 1.0 \[[WAI-WEBCONTENT](#bib-wai-webcontent "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0")\] and is designed to apply broadly to different web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

Significant challenges were encountered in defining additional criteria to address cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, including a short timeline for development as well as challenges in reaching consensus on testability, implementability, and international considerations of proposals. Work will carry on in this area in future versions of WCAG. We encourage authors to refer to our supplemental guidance on [improving inclusion for people with disabilities, including learning and cognitive disabilities, people with low-vision, and more](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement).

Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of web development and interaction work together, see:

- **[Essential Components of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/)**
- **[User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/)**
- **[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)**

Where this document refers to “WCAG 2” it is intended to mean any and all versions of WCAG that start with 2.

### WCAG 2 Layers of Guidance

The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall *principles*, general *guidelines*, testable *success criteria* and a rich collection of *sufficient techniques*, *advisory techniques*, and *documented common failures* with examples, resource links and code.

- **Principles** - At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for web accessibility: *perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust*. See also [Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility).

- **Guidelines** - Under the principles are guidelines. The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.

- **Success Criteria** - For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.2 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in [Understanding Levels of Conformance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#levels).

- **Sufficient and Advisory Techniques** - For each of the *guidelines* and *success criteria* in the WCAG 2.2 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of *techniques*. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are *sufficient* for meeting the success criteria and those that are *advisory*. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also [Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-techniques).

All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users.

Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive, language, and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, [Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/), as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. [Metadata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-metadata) may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs.

### WCAG 2.2 Supporting Documents

The WCAG 2.2 document is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical standard. Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on the WCAG 2.2 document and address other important purposes, including the ability to be updated to describe how WCAG would be applied with new technologies. Supporting documents include:

1.  **[How to Meet WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/)** - A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2.2 that includes all of the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques for authors to use as they are developing and evaluating web content. This includes content from WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, and can be filtered in many ways to help authors focus on relevant content.

2.  **[Understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/)** - A guide to understanding and implementing WCAG 2.2. There is a short "Understanding" document for each guideline and success criterion in WCAG 2.2 as well as key topics.

3.  **[Techniques for WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/)** - A collection of techniques and common failures, each in a separate document that includes a description, examples, code and tests.

4.  **[The WCAG 2 Documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/)** - A brief introduction to the WCAG 2 supporting documents and supplemental guidance.

5.  **[What's New in WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/)** introduces the new success criteria with persona quotes that illustrate the accessibility issues.

See [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for a description of the WCAG 2.2 supporting material, including education resources related to WCAG 2. Additional resources covering topics such as the business case for web accessibility, planning implementation to improve the accessibility of websites, and accessibility policies are listed in [WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/Overview).

### Requirements for WCAG 2.2

WCAG 2.2 meets a set of [requirements for WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/requirements/22/) which, in turn, inherit requirements from previous WCAG 2 versions. Requirements structure the overall framework of guidelines and ensure backwards compatibility. The Working Group also used a less formal set of acceptance criteria for success criteria, to help ensure success criteria are similar in style and quality to those in WCAG 2.0. These requirements constrained what could be included in WCAG 2.2. This constraint was important to preserve its nature as a dot-release of WCAG 2.

### Comparison with WCAG 2.1

WCAG 2.2 was initiated with the goal to continue the work of WCAG 2.1: Improving accessibility guidance for three major groups: users with cognitive or learning disabilities, users with low vision, and users with disabilities on mobile devices. Many ways to meet these needs were proposed and evaluated, and a set of these were refined by the Working Group. Structural requirements inherited from WCAG 2.0, clarity and impact of proposals, and timeline led to the final set of success criteria included in this version. The Working Group considers that WCAG 2.2 incrementally advances web content accessibility guidance for all these areas, but underscores that not all user needs are met by these guidelines.

WCAG 2.2 builds on and is backwards compatible with WCAG 2.1, meaning web pages that conform to WCAG 2.2 are at least as accessible as pages that conform to WCAG 2.1. Requirements have been added that build on 2.1 and 2.0. WCAG 2.2 has removed one success criterion, [4.1.1 Parsing](#parsing). Authors that are required by policy to conform with WCAG 2.0 or 2.1 will be able to update content to WCAG 2.2, but may need to continue to test and report 4.1.1. Authors following more than one version of the guidelines should be aware of the following additions.

#### New Features in WCAG 2.2

WCAG 2.2 extends WCAG 2.1 by adding new success criteria, definitions to support them, and guidelines to organize the additions. This additive approach helps to make it clear that sites which conform to WCAG 2.2 also conform to WCAG 2.1. The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group recommends that sites adopt WCAG 2.2 as their new conformance target, even if formal obligations mention previous versions, to provide improved accessibility and to anticipate future policy changes.

The following success criteria are new in WCAG 2.2:

- 2.4.11 [Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)](#focus-not-obscured-minimum) (AA)
- 2.4.12 [Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)](#focus-not-obscured-enhanced) (AAA)
- 2.4.13 [Focus Appearance](#focus-appearance) (AAA)
- 2.5.7 [Dragging Movements](#dragging-movements) (AA)
- 2.5.8 [Target Size (Minimum)](#target-size-minimum) (AA)
- 3.2.6 [Consistent Help](#consistent-help) (A)
- 3.3.7 [Redundant Entry](#redundant-entry) (A)
- 3.3.8 [Accessible Authentication (Minimum)](#accessible-authentication-minimum) (AA)
- 3.3.9 [Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)](#accessible-authentication-enhanced) (AAA)

The new success criteria may reference new terms that have also been added to the glossary and form part of the normative requirements of the success criteria.

WCAG 2.2 also introduces new sections detailing aspects of the specification which may impact [privacy](#privacy-summary) and [security](#security-summary).

#### Numbering in WCAG 2.2

In order to avoid confusion for implementers for whom backwards compatibility to WCAG 2 versions is important, new success criteria in WCAG 2.2 have been appended to the end of the set of success criteria within their guideline. This avoids the need to change the section number of success criteria from WCAG 2, which would be caused by inserting new success criteria between existing success criteria in the guideline, but it means success criteria in each guideline are no longer grouped by conformance level. The order of success criteria within each guideline does not imply information about conformance level; only the conformance level indicator (A / AA / AAA) on the success criterion itself indicates this. The [WCAG 2.2 Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) will provide a way to view success criteria grouped by conformance level, along with many other filter and sort options.

#### Conformance to WCAG 2.2

WCAG 2.2 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0. It is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.2 also conform to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1, while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web.

### Later Versions of Accessibility Guidelines

In parallel with WCAG 2.2, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is developing another major version of accessibility guidelines. The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The work follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.2 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0. The Working Group might also develop additional interim versions, continuing with WCAG 2.2, on a similar short timeline to provide additional support while the major version is completed.

## 1. Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

### Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives

All [non-text content](#dfn-non-text-content "any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language") that is presented to the user has a [text alternative](#dfn-text-alternative "Text that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.") that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

Controls, Input  
If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name](#dfn-name "text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user") that describes its purpose. (Refer to [Success Criterion 4.1.2](#name-role-value) for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)

Time-Based Media  
If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive
identification of the non-text content. (Refer to [Guideline 1.2](#time-based-media) for additional requirements for media.)

Test  
If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in [text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language"), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text
content.

Sensory  
If non-text content is primarily intended to create a [specific sensory experience](#dfn-specific-sensory-experience "a sensory experience that is not purely decorative and does not primarily convey important information or perform a function"), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text
content.

[CAPTCHA](#dfn-captcha "initialism for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"")  
If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by
a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe
the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA
using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate
different disabilities.

Decoration, Formatting, Invisible  
If non-text content is [pure decoration](#dfn-pure-decoration "serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality"), is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented
in a way that it can be ignored by [assistive technology](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents").

- Text can be resized without [assistive technology](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents") up to 200 percent in a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text [on a full-screen window](#dfn-on-a-full-screen-window "on the most common sized desktop/laptop display with the viewport maximized").

Note 1

Content is not required to use these values. The requirement is that a mechanism is available for users to change these presentation aspects. The mechanism can be provided by the browser or other user agent. Content is not required to provide the mechanism.

Note 2

Writing systems for some languages use different presentation aspects to improve readability and legibility. If a presentation aspect in this success criterion is not used in a writing system, content in that writing system does not need to use that presentation setting and can conform without it. Authors are encouraged to follow guidance for improving readability and legibility of text in their writing system.

#### Success Criterion 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception)

[Understanding Images of Text (No Exception)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text-no-exception.html) |  
[How to Meet Images of Text (No Exception)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#images-of-text-no-exception)

(Level AAA)

[Images of text](#dfn-images-of-text "text that has been rendered in a non-text form (e.g., an image) in order to achieve a particular visual effect") are only used for [pure decoration](#dfn-pure-decoration "serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality") or where a particular presentation of [text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language") is [essential](#dfn-essential "if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform") to the information being conveyed.

Note

Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.

#### Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow

[Understanding Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html) |  
[How to Meet Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#reflow)

(Level AA)

Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:

- Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixels "visual angle of about 0.0213 degrees");
- Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixels "visual angle of about 0.0213 degrees").

Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.

Note 1

320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting [viewport](#dfn-viewport "object in which the user agent presents content") width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.

Note 2

Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual cells), and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content. It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content.

#### Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast

[Understanding Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html) |  
[How to Meet Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#non-text-contrast)

(Level AA)

The visual [presentation](#dfn-presentation "rendering of the content in a form to be perceived by users") of the following have a [contrast ratio](#dfn-contrast-ratio "(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where") of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):

User Interface Components  
Visual information required to identify [user interface components](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") and [states](#dfn-states "dynamic property expressing characteristics of a user interface component that may change in response to user action or automated processes"), except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users") and not modified by the author;

Graphical Objects  
Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is [essential](#dfn-essential "if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform") to the information being conveyed.

#### Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text Spacing

[Understanding Text Spacing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/text-spacing.html) |  
[How to Meet Text Spacing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#text-spacing)

(Level AA)

In content implemented using markup languages that support the following [text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language") [style properties](#dfn-style-properties "property whose value determines the presentation (e.g. font, color, size, location, padding, volume, synthesized speech prosody) of content elements as they are rendered (e.g. onscreen, via loudspeaker, via braille display) by user agents"), no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:

- Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;
- Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;
- Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
- Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.

Exception: [Human languages](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans") and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script.

Note 1

Content is not required to use these text spacing values. The requirement is to ensure that when a user overrides the authored text spacing, content or functionality is not lost.

Note 2

Writing systems for some languages use different text spacing settings, such as paragraph start indent. Authors are encouraged to follow locally available guidance for improving readability and legibility of text in their writing system.

#### Success Criterion 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus

[Understanding Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html) |  
[How to Meet Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#content-on-hover-or-focus)

(Level AA)

Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:

Dismissible  
A [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an [input error](#dfn-input-error "information provided by the user that is not accepted") or does not obscure or replace other content;

Hoverable  
If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;

Persistent  
The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.

Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users") and is not modified by the author.

Note 1

Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML [`title` attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-title-attribute) \[[HTML](#bib-html "HTML Standard")\].

Note 2

Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.

Note 3

This criterion applies to content that appears in addition to the triggering component itself. Since hidden components that are made visible on keyboard focus (such as links used to skip to another part of a page) do not present additional content they are not covered by this criterion.

## 2. Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

### Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible

[Understanding Keyboard Accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard-accessible.html) |  
[How to Meet Keyboard Accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#keyboard-accessible)

Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

#### Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard

[Understanding Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html) |  
[How to Meet Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#keyboard)

(Level A)

All [functionality](#dfn-functionality "processes and outcomes achievable through user action") of the content is operable through a [keyboard interface](#dfn-keyboard-interface "interface used by software to obtain keystroke input") without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying
function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just
the endpoints.

Note 1

This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example,
if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent
input but the underlying function (text input) does not.

Note 2

This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input
methods in addition to keyboard operation.

#### Success Criterion 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap

[Understanding No Keyboard Trap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html) |  
[How to Meet No Keyboard Trap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#no-keyboard-trap)

(Level A)

If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a [keyboard interface](#dfn-keyboard-interface "interface used by software to obtain keystroke input"), then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface,
and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit
methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.

Note

Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to
meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](#cc5).

#### Success Criterion 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception)

[Understanding Keyboard (No Exception)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard-no-exception.html) |

[How to Meet Character Key Shortcuts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#character-key-shortcuts)

(Level A)

If a [keyboard shortcut](#dfn-keyboard-shortcuts "alternative means of triggering an action by the pressing of one or more keys") is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true:

Turn off  
A [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") is available to turn the shortcut off;

Remap  
A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt);

Active only on focus  
The keyboard shortcut for a [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") is only active when that component has focus.

### Guideline 2.2 Enough Time

#### Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable

[Understanding Timing Adjustable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html) |  
[How to Meet Timing Adjustable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#timing-adjustable)

(Level A)

For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:

Turn off  
The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or

Adjust  
The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range
that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or

Extend  
The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the
time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user
is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or

Real-time Exception  
The time limit is a required part of a [real-time event](#dfn-real-time-events "event that a) occurs at the same time as the viewing and b) is not completely generated by the content") (for example, an auction),
and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or

Essential Exception  
The time limit is [essential](#dfn-essential "if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform") and extending it would invalidate the activity; or

20 Hour Exception  
The time limit is longer than 20 hours.

Note

This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected
changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion
should be considered in conjunction with [Success Criterion 3.2.1](#on-focus), which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.

#### Success Criterion 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide

[Understanding Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html) |  
[How to Meet Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#pause-stop-hide)

(Level A)

For moving, [blinking](#dfn-blinking "switch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention"), scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:

Moving, blinking, scrolling  
For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2)
lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content,
there is a [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") for the user to [pause](#dfn-pause "stopped by user request and not resumed until requested by user"), stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity
where it is [essential](#dfn-essential "if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform"); and

Auto-updating  
For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented
in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop,
or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part
of an activity where it is essential.

Note 1

For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to [Guideline 2.3](#seizures-and-physical-reactions).

Note 2

Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to
meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](#cc5).

Note 3

Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent
is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between
the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically
possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.

Note 4

An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered
essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating
progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.

#### Success Criterion 2.2.3 No Timing

(Level AAA)

Users are warned of the duration of any [user inactivity](#dfn-user-inactivity "any continuous period of time where no user actions occur") that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours when the user does not take any actions.

Note

Privacy regulations may require explicit user consent before user identification has been authenticated and before user data is preserved. In cases where the user is a minor, explicit consent may not be solicited in most jurisdictions, countries or regions. Consultation with privacy professionals and legal counsel is advised when considering data preservation as an approach to satisfy this success criterion.

[How to Meet Focus Appearance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#focus-appearance)

(Level AAA)

New

When the keyboard [focus indicator](#dfn-focus-indicator "New") is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:

- is at least as large as the area of a 2 [CSS pixel](#dfn-css-pixels "visual angle of about 0.0213 degrees") thick [perimeter](#dfn-perimeter "New") of the unfocused component or sub-component, and
- has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.

Exceptions:

- The focus indicator is determined by the [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users") and cannot be adjusted by the author, or
- The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author.

Note 1

What is perceived as the user interface component or sub-component (to determine the perimeter) depends on its visual [presentation](#dfn-presentation "rendering of the content in a form to be perceived by users"). The visual presentation includes the component's visible [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions"), border, and component-specific background. It does not include shadow and glow effects outside the component's content, background, or border.

Note 2

Examples of sub-components that may receive a focus indicator are menu items in an opened drop-down menu, or focusable cells in a grid.

Note 3

Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined within the [technology](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") (such as HTML, CSS, and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent resolution enhancements and anti-aliasing can be ignored.

Up Reversal  
The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;

Essential  
Completing the function on the down-event is [essential](#dfn-essential "if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform").

Note 1

Functions that emulate a keyboard or numeric keypad key press are considered essential.

A [cognitive function test](#dfn-cognitive-function-test "New") (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication [process](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity") unless that step provides at least one of the following:

Alternative  
Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.

Mechanism  
A [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.

## 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

[How to Meet Parsing (Obsolete and removed)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#parsing)

Note

This criterion was originally adopted to address problems that assistive technology had directly parsing HTML. Assistive technology no longer has any need to directly parse HTML. Consequently, these problems either no longer exist or are addressed by other criteria. This criterion no longer has utility and is removed.

#### Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value

[How to Meet Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#name-role-value)

(Level A)

For all [user interface components](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts),
the [name](#dfn-name "text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user") and [role](#dfn-role "text or number by which software can identify the function of a component within Web content") can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities"); [states](#dfn-states "dynamic property expressing characteristics of a user interface component that may change in response to user action or automated processes"), properties, and values that can be set by the user can be [programmatically set](#dfn-programmatically-set "set by software using methods that are supported by user agents, including assistive technologies"); and notification of changes to these items is available to [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents").

Note

This success criterion is primarily for web authors who develop or script their own
user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success
criterion when used according to specification.

#### Success Criterion 4.1.3 Status Messages

[How to Meet Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#status-messages)

(Level AA)

In content implemented using markup languages, [status messages](#dfn-status-messages "change in content that is not a change of context, and that provides information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting state of an application, on the progress of a process, or on the existence of errors") can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities") through [role](#dfn-role "text or number by which software can identify the function of a component within Web content") or properties such that they can be presented to the user by [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents") without receiving focus.

## 5. Conformance

This section lists requirements for [conformance](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification") to WCAG 2.2. It also gives information about how to make conformance claims, which are optional. Finally, it describes what it means to be [accessibility supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents"), since only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies can be [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") for conformance. [Understanding Conformance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance) includes further explanation of the accessibility-supported concept.

### 5.1 Interpreting Normative Requirements

The main content of WCAG 2.2 is [normative](#dfn-normative "required for conformance") and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as "non-normative", diagrams, examples, and notes are [informative](#dfn-informative "for information purposes and not required for conformance") (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.

The key words *MAY*, *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *NOT RECOMMENDED*, *RECOMMENDED*, *SHOULD*, and *SHOULD NOT* are to be interpreted as described in \[[RFC2119](#bib-rfc2119 "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels")\].

### 5.2 Conformance Requirements

In order for a web page to conform to WCAG 2.2, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:

#### 5.2.1 Conformance Level

One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.

- For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent")
  [satisfies](#dfn-satisfies "the success criterion does not evaluate to 'false' when applied to the page") all the Level A success criteria, or a [conforming alternate version](#dfn-conforming-alternate-versions "version that") is provided.
- For Level AA conformance, the web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA success criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.
- For Level AAA conformance, the web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA success criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.

Note 1

Although conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.

Note 2

It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA success criteria for some content.

#### 5.2.2 Full pages

[Conformance](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification") (and conformance level) is for full [web page(s)](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") only, and cannot be achieved if part of a web page is excluded.

Note 1

For the purpose of determining conformance, alternatives to part of a page's content are considered part of the page when the alternatives can be obtained directly from the page, e.g., a long description or an alternative presentation of a video.

Note 2

Authors of web pages that cannot conform due to content outside of the author's control may consider a [Statement of Partial Conformance](#conformance-partial).

Note 3

A full page includes each variation of the page that is automatically presented by the page for various screen sizes (e.g. variations in a responsive web page). Each of these variations needs to conform (or needs to have a conforming alternate version) in order for the entire page to conform.

#### 5.2.3 Complete processes

When a [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") is one of a series of web pages presenting a [process](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity") (i.e., a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity), all web pages in the process conform at the specified level or better. (Conformance is not possible at a particular level if any page in the process does not conform at that level or better.)

Example

An online store has a series of pages that are used to select and purchase products. All pages in the series from start to finish (checkout) conform in order for any page that is part of the process to conform.

#### 5.2.4 Only Accessibility-Supported Ways of Using Technologies

Only [accessibility-supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents") ways of using [technologies](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") are [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") to satisfy the success criteria. Any information or functionality that is provided in a way that is not accessibility supported is also available in a way that is accessibility supported. (See [Understanding accessibility support](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#accessibility-support).)

#### 5.2.5 Non-Interference

If [technologies](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") are used in a way that is not [accessibility supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents"), or if they are used in a non-conforming way, then they do not block the ability of users to access the rest of the page. In addition, the [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") as a whole continues to meet the conformance requirements under each of the following conditions:

1.  when any technology that is not [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") is turned on in a user agent,
2.  when any technology that is not relied upon is turned off in a user agent, and
3.  when any technology that is not relied upon is not supported by a user agent

In addition, the following success criteria apply to all content on the page, including content that is not otherwise relied upon to meet conformance, because failure to meet them could interfere with any use of the page:

- **1.4.2 - Audio Control**,
- **2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap**,
- **2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below Threshold**, and
- **2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide**.

Note

If a page cannot conform (for example, a conformance test page or an example page), it cannot be included in the scope of conformance or in a conformance claim.

For more information, including examples, see [Understanding Conformance Requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#conformance-requirements).

### 5.3 Conformance Claims (Optional)

Conformance is defined only for [web pages](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent"). However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one page, a series of pages, or multiple related web pages.

#### 5.3.1 Required Components of a Conformance Claim

Conformance claims are **not required**. Authors can conform to WCAG 2.2 without making a claim. However, if a conformance claim is made, then the conformance claim **must** include the following information:

1.  **Date** of the claim

2.  **Guidelines title, version and URI** "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 at <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/>"

3.  **Conformance level** satisfied: (Level A, AA or AAA)

4.  **A concise description of the web pages**, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including whether subdomains are included in the claim.

    Note 1

    The web pages may be described by list or by an expression that describes all of the URIs included in the claim.

    Note 2

    Web-based products that do not have a URI prior to installation on the customer's website may have a statement that the product would conform when installed.

5.  A list of the
    **[web content technologies](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents")
    [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported")**.

Note 3

If a conformance logo is used, it would constitute a claim and must be accompanied by the required components of a conformance claim listed above.

#### 5.3.2 Optional Components of a Conformance Claim

In addition to the required components of a conformance claim above, consider providing additional information to assist users. Recommended additional information includes:

- A list of success criteria beyond the level of conformance claimed that have been met. This information should be provided in a form that users can use, preferably machine-readable metadata.
- A list of the specific technologies that are " *used but not [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported")*."
- A list of user agents, including assistive technologies that were used to test the content.
- A list of specific accessibility characteristics of the content, provided in machine-readable metadata.
- Information about any additional steps taken that go beyond the success criteria to enhance accessibility.
- A machine-readable metadata version of the list of specific technologies that are [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported").
- A machine-readable metadata version of the conformance claim.

Note 1

Refer to [Understanding Conformance Claims](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#conformance-claims) for more information and example conformance claims.

Note 2

Refer to [Understanding Metadata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-metadata) for more information about the use of metadata in conformance claims.

### 5.4 Statement of Partial Conformance - Third Party Content

Web pages that will later have additional content added can use a 'statement of partial conformance'. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.

In these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:

1.  A determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;

    **OR**

2.  A "statement of partial conformance" may be made that the page does not conform, but could conform if certain parts were removed. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.2 at level X if the following parts from uncontrolled sources were removed." In addition, the following would also be true of uncontrolled content that is described in the statement of partial conformance:

    1.  It is not content that is under the author's control.
    2.  It is described in a way that users can identify (e.g., they cannot be described as "all parts that we do not control" unless they are clearly marked as such.)

### 5.5 Statement of Partial Conformance - Language

A "statement of partial conformance due to language" may be made when the page does not conform, but would conform if [accessibility support](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents") existed for (all of) the language(s) used on the page. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.2 at level X if accessibility support existed for the following language(s):"

### 5.6 Privacy Considerations

*This section is non-normative.*

Success criteria within this specification which the Working Group has identified possible implications for privacy, either by providing protections for end users or which are important for website providers to take in to consideration when implementing features designed to protect user privacy, are listed below. This list reflects the current understanding of the Working Group but other Success criteria may have privacy implications that the Working Group is not aware of at the time of publishing.

Success criteria within this specification that may relate to privacy are:

- [2.2.6 Timeouts (AAA)](#timeouts)
- [3.3.7 Redundant Entry (A)](#redundant-entry)

### 5.7 Security Considerations

*This section is non-normative.*

Success criteria within this specification which the Working Group has identified possible implications for security, either by providing protections for end users or which are important for website providers to take in to consideration when implementing features designed to protect user security, are listed below. This list reflects the current understanding of the Working Group but other Success criteria may have security implications that the Working Group is not aware of at the time of publishing.

Success criteria within this specification that may relate to security are:

- [1.1.1 Non-text Content (A)](#non-text-content)

- [3.3.9 Accessible Authentication (Enhanced) (AAA)](#accessible-authentication-enhanced)

## 6. Glossary

abbreviation  
shortened form of a word, phrase, or name where the abbreviation has not become part
of the language

Note 1

This includes initialisms and acronyms where:

1.  **initialisms** are shortened forms of a name or phrase made from the initial letters of words or
    syllables contained in that name or phrase

    Note 2

    Not defined in all languages.

    Example 1

    SNCF is a French initialism that contains the initial letters of the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer, the French national railroad.

    Example 2

    ESP is an initialism for extrasensory perception.

2.  **acronyms** are abbreviated forms made from the initial letters or parts of other words (in a
    name or phrase) which may be pronounced as a word

    Example 3

    NOAA is an acronym made from the initial letters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration in the United States.

Note 3

Some companies have adopted what used to be an initialism as their company name. In
these cases, the new name of the company is the letters (for example, Ecma) and the
word is no longer considered an abbreviation.

accessibility supported  
supported by users' [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents") as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users")

To qualify as an accessibility-supported use of a web content technology (or feature
of a technology), both 1 and 2 must be satisfied for a web content technology (or
feature):

1.  **The way that the [web content technology](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") is used must be supported by users' assistive technology (AT).** This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability
    with users' assistive technology in the [human language(s)](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans") of the content,

    **AND**

2.  **The web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are
    available to users.** This means that at least one of the following four statements is true:

    1.  The technology is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents that are also
        accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS);

        **OR**

    2.  The technology is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in that is also accessibility
        supported;

        **OR**

    3.  The content is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate
        network, where the user agent required by the technology and used by the organization
        is also accessibility supported;

        **OR**

    4.  The user agent(s) that support the technology are accessibility supported and are
        available for download or purchase in a way that:

        - does not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability
          **and**
        - is as easy to find and obtain for a person with a disability as it is for a person
          without disabilities.

Note 1

The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive
technologies there must be for a particular use of a web technology in order for it
to be classified as accessibility supported. (See [Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#support-level).)

Note 2

Web technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long
as they are not [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including [Conformance Requirement 4](#cc4) and [Conformance Requirement 5](#cc5).

Note 3

When a [web technology](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") is used in a way that is "accessibility supported," it does not imply that the entire
technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including
HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if
the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to
meet WCAG requirements.

Note 4

When citing web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported
should be specified.

Note 5

One way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported
would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported.
(See [Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#documented-lists).) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported
ways of using web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in
the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web
content technologies above.

alternative for time-based media  
document including correctly sequenced text descriptions of time-based visual and
auditory information and providing a means for achieving the outcomes of any time-based
interaction

Note

A screenplay used to create the synchronized media content would meet this definition
only if it was corrected to accurately represent the final synchronized media after
editing.

ambiguous to users in general  
the purpose cannot be determined from the link and all information of the web page
presented to the user simultaneously with the link (i.e., readers without disabilities
would not know what a link would do until they activated it)

Example

The word guava in the following sentence "One of the notable exports is guava" is
a link. The link could lead to a definition of guava, a chart listing the quantity
of guava exported or a photograph of people harvesting guava. Until the link is activated,
all readers are unsure and the person with a disability is not at any disadvantage.

ASCII art  
picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the
95 printable characters defined by ASCII)

assistive technology (as used in this document)  
hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements
of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note 1

Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations
(e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g.,
voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations
(e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note 2

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents
by using and monitoring APIs.

Note 3

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing
markup into identifiable bundles.

Example

Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include
the following:

- screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with
  visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing,
  color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability
  of rendered text and images;
- screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information
  through synthesized speech or braille;
- text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and
  learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
- speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;
- alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities
  to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single
  switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);
- alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities
  to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.

audio  
the technology of sound reproduction

Note

Audio can be created synthetically (including speech synthesis), recorded from real
world sounds, or both.

audio description  
narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot
be understood from the main soundtrack alone

Note 1

Audio description of [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and
other visual content.

Note 2

In standard audio description, narration is added during existing pauses in dialogue.
(See also [extended audio description](#dfn-extended-audio-description "audio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the video so that there is time to add additional description").)

Note 3

Where all of the [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") information is already provided in existing [audio](#dfn-audio "the technology of sound reproduction"), no additional audio description is necessary.

Note 4

Also called "video description" and "descriptive narration."

audio-only  
a time-based presentation that contains only [audio](#dfn-audio "the technology of sound reproduction") (no [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") and no interaction)

blinking  
switch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention

Note

See also [flash](#dfn-flashes "a pair of opposing changes in relative luminance that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency range"). It is possible for something to be large enough and blink brightly enough at the
right frequency to be also classified as a flash.

blocks of text  
more than one sentence of text

CAPTCHA  
initialism for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans
Apart"

Note 1

CAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an
obscured image or audio file.

Note 2

A Turing test is any system of tests designed to differentiate a human from a computer.
It is named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing. The term was coined by researchers
at Carnegie Mellon University.

captions  
synchronized visual and/or [text alternative](#dfn-text-alternative "Text that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.") for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content

Note 1

Captions are similar to dialogue-only subtitles except captions convey not only the
content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information
needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter,
speaker identification and location.

Note 2

Closed Captions are equivalents that can be turned on and off with some players.

Note 3

Open Captions are any captions that cannot be turned off. For example, if the captions
are visual equivalent [images of text](#dfn-images-of-text "text that has been rendered in a non-text form (e.g., an image) in order to achieve a particular visual effect") embedded in [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images").

Note 4

Captions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.

Note 5

In some countries, captions are called subtitles.

Note 6

[Audio descriptions](#dfn-audio-descriptions "narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone") can be, but do not need to be, captioned since they are descriptions of information
that is already presented visually.

changes of context  
major changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view
the entire page simultaneously

Changes in context include changes of:

- [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users");
- [viewport](#dfn-viewport "object in which the user agent presents content");
- focus;
- [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions") that changes the meaning of the [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent")

Note

A change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as
an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the
context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).

Example

Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including
anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly
re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.

cognitive function test  
New

A task that requires the user to remember, manipulate, or transcribe information. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- memorization, such as remembering a username, password, set of characters, images, or patterns. The common identifiers name, e-mail, and phone number are not considered cognitive function tests as they are personal to the user and consistent across websites;
- transcription, such as typing in characters;
- use of correct spelling;
- performance of calculations;
- solving of puzzles.

conformance  
satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification

conforming alternate version  
version that

1.  conforms at the designated level, and

2.  provides all of the same information and [functionality](#dfn-functionality "processes and outcomes achievable through user action") in the same [human language](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans"), and

3.  is as up to date as the non-conforming content, and

4.  for which at least one of the following is true:

    1.  the conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an [accessibility-supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported "supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents")
        [mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result"), or
    2.  the non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version, or
    3.  the non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides
        a mechanism to reach the conforming version

Note 1

In this definition, "can only be reached" means that there is some mechanism, such
as a conditional redirect, that prevents a user from "reaching" (loading) the non-conforming
page unless the user had just come from the conforming version.

Note 2

The alternate version does not need to be matched page for page with the original
(e.g., the conforming alternate version may consist of multiple pages).

Note 3

If multiple language versions are available, then conforming alternate versions are
required for each language offered.

Note 4

Alternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments
or user groups. Each version should be as conformant as possible. One version would
need to be fully conformant in order to meet [conformance requirement 1](#cc1).

Note 5

The conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance,
or even on the same website, as long as it is as freely available as the non-conforming
version.

Note 6

Alternate versions should not be confused with [supplementary content](#dfn-supplementary-content "additional content that illustrates or clarifies the primary content"), which support the original page and enhance comprehension.

Note 7

Setting user preferences within the content to produce a conforming version is an
acceptable mechanism for reaching another version as long as the method used to set
the preferences is accessibility supported.

See [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions)

content (web content)  
information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), including code or markup that defines the content's [structure](#dfn-structure "The way the parts of a web page are organized in relation to each other; and The way a collection of web pages is organized"), [presentation](#dfn-presentation "rendering of the content in a form to be perceived by users"), and interactions

context-sensitive help  
help text that provides information related to the function currently being performed

Note

Clear labels can act as context-sensitive help.

contrast ratio  
(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where

- L1 is the [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance "the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white") of the lighter of the colors, and
- L2 is the [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance "the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white") of the darker of the colors.

Note 1

Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).

Note 2

Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered
(for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be
evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.

Note 3

For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect
to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no
background color is specified, then white is assumed.

Note 4

Background color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered
in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text
color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot
be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text
color is specified when a background color is specified.

Note 5

When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be
used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border
around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that
fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.

Note 6

WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that
an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not
consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except
where caused by authors' code.

correct reading sequence  
any sequence where words and paragraphs are presented in an order that does not change
the meaning of the content

CSS pixel  
visual angle of about 0.0213 degrees

A CSS pixel is the canonical unit of measure for all lengths and measurements in CSS.
This unit is density-independent, and distinct from actual hardware pixels present
in a display. User agents and operating systems should ensure that a CSS pixel is
set as closely as possible to the [CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 reference pixel](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#reference-pixel) \[[css3-values](#bib-css3-values "CSS Values and Units Module Level 3")\], which takes into account the physical dimensions of the display
and the assumed viewing distance (factors that cannot be determined by content authors).

down-event  
platform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is depressed

The down-event may have different names on different platforms, such as "touchstart" or "mousedown".

dragging movement  
New

an operation where the pointer engages with an element on the [down-event](#dfn-down-event "platform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is depressed") and the element (or a representation of its position) follows the pointer until an [up-event](#dfn-up-event "platform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is released")

Note

Examples of draggable elements include list items, text elements, and images.

emergency  
a sudden, unexpected situation or occurrence that requires immediate action to preserve
health, safety, or property

essential  
if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content,
**and** information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform

extended audio description  
audio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") so that there is time to add additional description

Note

This technique is only used when the sense of the [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") would be lost without the additional [audio description](#dfn-audio-descriptions "narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone") and the pauses between dialogue/narration are too short.

flash  
a pair of opposing changes in [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance "the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white") that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency
range

Note 1

See [general flash and red flash thresholds](#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds "a flash or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content passes) if any of the following are true:") for information about types of flash that are not allowed.

Note 2

See also [blinking](#dfn-blinking "switch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention").

focus indicator  
New

pixels that are changed to visually indicate when a [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") is in a focused [state](#dfn-states "dynamic property expressing characteristics of a user interface component that may change in response to user action or automated processes")

functionality  
[processes](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity") and outcomes achievable through user action

general flash and red flash thresholds  
a [flash](#dfn-flashes "a pair of opposing changes in relative luminance that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency range") or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content **passes**) if any of the following are true:

- there are no more than three **general flashes** and / or no more than three **red flashes** within any one-second period; or
- the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total
  of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10
  degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance

where:

- A **general flash** is defined as a pair of opposing changes in [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance "the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white") of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance (1.0) where the relative luminance of
  the darker image is below 0.80; and where "a pair of opposing changes" is an increase
  followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and
- A **red flash** is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red

*Exception:* Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating
checkerboard pattern with "squares" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical
viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.

Note 1

For general software or web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). This resolution of 75 - 85 ppi is known to be lower, and thus more conservative than the nominal CSS pixel resolution of 96 ppi in CSS specifications. Higher resolutions displays showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.

Note 2

A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for
red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or
relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists
of two opposing transitions.

Note 3

The new working definition in the field for **"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red"** (from WCAG 2.2) is a pair of opposing transitions where, one transition is either to or from a state with a value R/(R + G + B) that is greater than or equal to 0.8, and the difference between states is more than 0.2 (unitless) in the CIE 1976 UCS chromaticity diagram. \[[ISO_9241-391](#bib-iso_9241-391 "Ergonomics of human-system interaction—Part 391: Requirements, analysis and compliance test methods for the reduction of photosensitive seizures")\]

Note 4

Tools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However,
no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal
to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see \#1 and \#2 above).

human language  
language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate
with humans

Note

See also [sign language](#dfn-sign-language "a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions, or body positions to convey meaning").

idiom  
phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from the meaning of the individual words and
the specific words cannot be changed without losing the meaning

Note

Idioms cannot be translated directly, word for word, without losing their (cultural
or language-dependent) meaning.

Example 1

In English, "spilling the beans" means "revealing a secret." However, "knocking over
the beans" or "spilling the vegetables" does not mean the same thing.

Example 2

In Japanese, the phrase "さじを投げる" literally translates into "he throws a spoon," but it means that there is nothing
he can do and finally he gives up.

Example 3

In Dutch, "Hij ging met de kippen op stok" literally translates into "He went to roost with the chickens," but it means that
he went to bed early.

image of text  
text that has been rendered in a non-text form (e.g., an image) in order to achieve
a particular visual effect

Note

This does not include text that is part of a picture that contains significant other visual content.

Example

A person's name on a nametag in a photograph.

informative  
for information purposes and not required for conformance

Note

Content required for [conformance](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification") is referred to as "[normative](#dfn-normative "required for conformance")."

input error  
information provided by the user that is not accepted

Note

This includes:

1.  Information that is required by the [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") but omitted by the user
2.  Information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data
    format or values

jargon  
words used in a particular way by people in a particular field

Example

The word StickyKeys is jargon from the field of assistive technology/accessibility.

keyboard interface  
interface used by software to obtain keystroke input

Note 1

A keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the
native technology does not contain a keyboard.

Example

A touchscreen PDA has a keyboard interface built into its operating system as well
as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface
to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications
that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text
applications with "keyboard emulation" functionality.

Note 2

Operation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated
mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard
interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface,
not through its keyboard interface.

keyboard shortcut  
alternative means of triggering an action by the pressing of one or more keys

label  
[text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language") or other component with a [text alternative](#dfn-text-alternative "Text that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.") that is presented to a user to identify a component within web [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions")

Note 1

A label is presented to all users whereas the [name](#dfn-name "text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user") may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases
the name and the label are the same.

Note 2

The term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.

large scale (text)  
with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size
for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts

Note 1

Fonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that
reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower
contrast levels.

Note 2

Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing
that may be done by a user.

Note 3

The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined
size and the user's display or user agent settings. For many mainstream body text
fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150%
of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors
would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in
relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display.
The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font
metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who
have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.

Note 4

When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major
browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If
a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would
be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from
the default sizes in a similar fashion.

Note 5

The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large
print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK
languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those
languages and the next larger standard large print size.

legal commitments  
transactions where the person incurs a legally binding obligation or benefit

Example

A marriage license, a stock trade (financial and legal), a will, a loan, adoption,
signing up for the army, a contract of any type, etc.

link purpose  
nature of the result obtained by activating a hyperlink

live  
information captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with
no more than a broadcast delay

Note 1

A broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order
to give the broadcaster time to cue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient
to allow significant editing.

Note 2

If information is completely computer generated, it is not live.

lower secondary education level  
the two or three year period of education that begins after completion of six years
of school and ends nine years after the beginning of [primary education](#dfn-primary-education "six year time period that begins between the ages of five and seven, possibly without any previous education")

Note

This definition is based on the International Standard Classification of Education
\[[UNESCO](#bib-unesco "International Standard Classification of Education")\].

mechanism  
[process](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity") or technique for achieving a result

Note 1

The mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content, or may be [relied upon](#dfn-relied-upon "the content would not conform if that technology is turned off or is not supported") to be provided by either the platform or by [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents").

Note 2

The mechanism needs to meet all success criteria for the conformance level claimed.

media alternative for text  
media that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly
or via text alternatives)

Note

A media alternative for text is provided for those who benefit from alternate representations
of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language
video), or audio-video.

motion animation  
addition of steps between conditions to create the illusion of movement or to give a sense of a smooth transition

Example

For example, an element which moves into place or changes size while appearing is considered to be animated. An element which appears instantly without transitioning is not using animation. Motion animation does not include changes of color, blurring, or opacity which do not change the perceived size, shape, or position of the element.

minimum bounding box  
New

the smallest enclosing rectangle aligned to the horizontal axis within which all the points of a shape lie. For components which wrap onto multiple lines as part of a sentence or [block of text](#dfn-blocks-of-text "more than one sentence of text") (such as hypertext links), the bounding box is based on how the component would appear on a single line.

name  
text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user

Note 1

The name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a [label](#dfn-labels "text or other component with a text alternative that is presented to a user to identify a component within web content") is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are
the same.

Note 2

This is unrelated to the name attribute in HTML.

navigated sequentially  
navigated in the order defined for advancing focus (from one element to the next)
using a [keyboard interface](#dfn-keyboard-interface "interface used by software to obtain keystroke input")

non-text content  
any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities") or where the sequence is not expressing something in [human language](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans")

Note

This includes [ASCII art](#dfn-ascii-art "picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII)") (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, leetspeak (which uses character substitution),
and images representing text

normative  
required for conformance

Note 1

One may conform in a variety of well-defined ways to this document.

Note 2

Content identified as "[informative](#dfn-informative "for information purposes and not required for conformance")" or "non-normative" is never required for [conformance](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification").

on a full-screen window  
on the most common sized desktop/laptop display with the [viewport](#dfn-viewport "object in which the user agent presents content") maximized

Note

Since people generally keep their computers for several years, it is best not to rely
on the latest desktop/laptop display resolutions but to consider the common desktop/laptop
display resolutions over the course of several years when making this evaluation.

paused  
stopped by user request and not resumed until requested by user

perimeter  
New

continuous line forming the boundary of a shape not including shared pixels, or the [minimum bounding box](#dfn-bounding-boxes "New"), whichever is shortest.

Example

The perimeter calculation for a 2 CSS pixel perimeter around a rectangle is 4*h*+4*w*, where *h* is the height and *w* is the width. For a 2 CSS pixel perimeter around a circle it is 4𝜋*r*.

pointer input  
input from a device that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen,
such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact

Note

See the [Pointer Events
definition for "pointer"](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/#dfn-pointer) \[[pointerevents](#bib-pointerevents "Pointer Events")\].

prerecorded  
information that is not [live](#dfn-live "information captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with no more than a broadcast delay")

presentation  
rendering of the [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions") in a form to be perceived by users

primary education level  
six year time period that begins between the ages of five and seven, possibly without
any previous education

Note

This definition is based on the International Standard Classification of Education
\[[UNESCO](#bib-unesco "International Standard Classification of Education")\].

process  
series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity

Example 1

Successful use of a series of web pages on a shopping site requires users to view
alternative products, prices and offers, select products, submit an order, provide
shipping information and provide payment information.

Example 2

An account registration page requires successful completion of a [Turing test](https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/) before
the registration form can be accessed.

programmatically determined (programmatically determinable)  
determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different
[user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents"), can extract and present this information to users in different modalities

Example 1

Determined in a markup language from elements and attributes that are accessed directly
by commonly available assistive technology.

Example 2

Determined from technology-specific data structures in a non-markup language and exposed
to assistive technology via an accessibility API that is supported by commonly available
assistive technology.

programmatically determined link context  
additional information that can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities") from [relationships](#dfn-relationships "meaningful associations between distinct pieces of content") with a link, combined with the link text, and presented to users in different modalities

Example

In HTML, information that is programmatically determinable from a link in English
includes text that is in the same [paragraph](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraph),
list item, or table cell as the link or in a table header cell that is associated with the table cell that contains the link.

Note

Since screen readers interpret punctuation, they can also provide the context from
the current sentence, when the focus is on a link in that sentence.

programmatically set  
set by software using methods that are supported by [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users"), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents")

pure decoration  
serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality

Note

Text is only purely decorative if the words can be rearranged or substituted without
changing their purpose.

Example

The cover page of a dictionary has random words in very light text in the background.

real-time event  
event that a) occurs at the same time as the viewing and b) is not completely generated
by the content

Example 1

A Webcast of a live performance (occurs at the same time as the viewing and is not
prerecorded).

Example 2

An on-line auction with people bidding (occurs at the same time as the viewing).

Example 3

Live humans interacting in a virtual world using avatars (is not completely generated
by the content and occurs at the same time as the viewing).

region  
perceivable, [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities") [section](#dfn-section "a self-contained portion of written content that deals with one or more related topics or thoughts") of content

Note

In HTML, any area designated with a landmark role would be a region.

relationships  
meaningful associations between distinct pieces of content

relative luminance  
the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest
black and 1 for lightest white

Note 1

For the sRGB colorspace, the relative luminance of a color is defined as L = 0.2126
\* **R** + 0.7152 \* **G** + 0.0722 \* **B** where **R**, **G** and **B** are defined as:

- if RsRGB \<= 0.04045 then **R** = RsRGB/12.92 else **R** = ((RsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
- if GsRGB \<= 0.04045 then **G** = GsRGB/12.92 else **G** = ((GsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
- if BsRGB \<= 0.04045 then **B** = BsRGB/12.92 else **B** = ((BsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4

and RsRGB, GsRGB, and BsRGB are defined as:

- RsRGB = R8bit/255
- GsRGB = G8bit/255
- BsRGB = B8bit/255

The "^" character is the exponentiation operator. (Formula taken from
\[[SRGB](#bib-srgb "Multimedia systems and equipment - Colour measurement and management - Part 2-1: Colour management - Default RGB colour space - sRGB")\].)

Note 2

Before May 2021 the value of 0.04045 in the definition was different (0.03928). It was taken from an older version of the specification and has been updated. It has no practical effect on the calculations in the context of these guidelines.

Note 3

Almost all systems used today to view web content assume sRGB encoding. Unless it
is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content,
authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum).

Note 4

If dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors
that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered
should be used (average R, average G, and average B).

Note 5

Tools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing contrast and
flash.

Note 6

A [separate page giving the relative luminance definition using MathML](relative-luminance.html) to display the formulas is available.

relied upon (technologies that are)  
the content would not [conform](#dfn-conform "satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification") if that [technology](#dfn-technologies "mechanism for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by user agents") is turned off or is not supported

role  
text or number by which software can identify the function of a component within Web
content

Example

A number that indicates whether an image functions as a hyperlink, command button,
or check box.

same functionality  
same result when used

Example

A submit "search" button on one web page and a "find" button on another web page may
both have a field to enter a term and list topics in the website related to the term
submitted. In this case, they would have the same functionality but would not be labeled
consistently.

same relative order  
same position relative to other items

Note

Items are considered to be in the same relative order even if other items are inserted
or removed from the original order. For example, expanding navigation menus may insert
an additional level of detail or a secondary navigation section may be inserted into
the reading order.

satisfies a success criterion  
the success criterion does not evaluate to 'false' when applied to the page

section  
a self-contained portion of written content that deals with one or more related topics
or thoughts

Note

A section may consist of one or more paragraphs and include graphics, tables, lists
and sub-sections.

set of web pages  
collection of [web pages](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization

Example

Examples include:

- a publication which is split across multiple web pages, where each page contains one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the full set of pages.
- an e-commerce website shows products in a set of web pages that all share the same navigation and identification. However, when progressing to the checkout process, the template changes; the navigation and other elements are removed, so the pages in that process are functionally and visually different. The checkout pages are not part of the set of product pages.
- a blog on a sub-domain (e.g. blog.example.com) which has a different navigation and is authored by a distinct set of people from the pages on the primary domain (example.com).

Note

Different language versions would be considered different sets of web pages.

sign language  
a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions,
or body positions to convey meaning

sign language interpretation  
translation of one language, generally a spoken language, into a [sign language](#dfn-sign-language "a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions, or body positions to convey meaning")

Note

True sign languages are independent languages that are unrelated to the spoken language(s)
of the same country or region.

single pointer  
an input modality that only targets a single point on the page/screen at a time – such as a mouse, single finger on a touch screen, or stylus.

Note

Single pointer interactions include clicks, double clicks, taps, dragging motions, and single-finger swipe gestures. In contrast, multipoint interactions involve the use of two or more pointers at the same time, such as two-finger interactions on a touchscreen, or the simultaneous use of a mouse and stylus.

specific sensory experience  
a sensory experience that is not purely decorative and does not primarily convey important
information or perform a function

Example

Examples include a performance of a flute solo, works of visual art etc.

state  
dynamic property expressing characteristics of a [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") that may change in response to user action or automated processes

States do not affect the nature of the component, but represent data associated with the component or user interaction possibilities. Examples include focus, hover, select, press, check, visited/unvisited, and expand/collapse.

status message  
change in content that is not a [change of context](#dfn-change-of-context "major changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view the entire page simultaneously"), and that provides information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting state of an application, on the progress of a [process](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity"), or on the existence of errors

structure  
- The way the parts of a [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") are organized in relation to each other; and
- The way a collection of [web pages](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent") is organized

style property  
property whose value determines the presentation (e.g. font, color, size, location, padding, volume, synthesized speech prosody) of
content elements as they are rendered (e.g. onscreen, via loudspeaker, via braille display) by user agents

Style properties can have several origins:

- User agent default styles: The default style property values applied in the absence of any author or user styles. Some web content technologies specify a default rendering, others do not;
- Author styles: Style property values that are set by the author as part of the content (e.g. in-line styles, author style
  sheets);
- User styles: Style property values that are set by the user (e.g. via user agent interface settings, user style sheets)

supplemental content  
additional [content](#dfn-content "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions") that illustrates or clarifies the primary content

Example 1

An audio version of a [web page](#dfn-web-page-s "a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent").

Example 2

An illustration of a complex [process](#dfn-processes "series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity").

Example 3

A paragraph summarizing the major outcomes and recommendations made in a research
study.

synchronized media  
[audio](#dfn-audio "the technology of sound reproduction") or [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") synchronized with another format for presenting information and/or with time-based
interactive components, unless the media is a [media alternative for text](#dfn-media-alternative-for-text "media that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly or via text alternatives)") that is clearly labeled as such

target  
region of the display that will accept a pointer action, such as the interactive area of a [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function")

Note

If two or more targets are overlapping, the overlapping area should not be included in the measurement of the target size, except when the overlapping targets perform the same action or open the same page.

technology (web content)  
[mechanism](#dfn-mechanism "process or technique for achieving a result") for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by [user agents](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users")

Note 1

As used in these guidelines "web technology" and the word "technology" (when used
alone) both refer to web content technologies.

Note 2

Web content technologies may include markup languages, data formats, or programming
languages that authors may use alone or in combination to create end-user experiences
that range from static web pages to synchronized media presentations to dynamic Web
applications.

Example

Some common examples of web content technologies include HTML, CSS, SVG, PNG, PDF,
Flash, and JavaScript.

text  
sequence of characters that can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities"), where the sequence is expressing something in [human language](#dfn-human-language-s "language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans")

text alternative  
[Text](#dfn-text "sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language") that is programmatically associated with [non-text content](#dfn-non-text-content "any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language") or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content.
Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable "determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities")
from the non-text content.

Example

An image of a chart is described in text in the paragraph after the chart. The short
text alternative for the chart indicates that a description follows.

Note

Refer to [Understanding Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#text-alternatives) for more information.

up-event  
platform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is released

The up-event may have different names on different platforms, such as "touchend" or "mouseup".

used in an unusual or restricted way  
words used in such a way that requires users to know exactly which definition to apply
in order to understand the content correctly

Example

The term "gig" means something different if it occurs in a discussion of music concerts
than it does in article about computer hard drive space, but the appropriate definition
can be determined from context. By contrast, the word "text" is used in a very specific
way in WCAG 2, so a definition is supplied in the glossary.

user agent  
any software that retrieves and presents web content for users

Example

Web browsers, media players, plug-ins, and other programs — including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents") — that help in retrieving, rendering, and interacting with web content.

user-controllable  
data that is intended to be accessed by users

Note

This does not refer to such things as Internet logs and search engine monitoring data.

Example

Name and address fields for a user's account.

user interface component  
a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct
function

Note 1

Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element.
"Components" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user
perceives as separate controls.

Note 2

User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated
by scripts.

Note 3

What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes
called "user interface element".

Example

An applet has a "control" that can be used to move through content by line or page
or random access. Since each of these would need to have a name and be settable independently,
they would each be a "user interface component."

user inactivity  
any continuous period of time where no user actions occur

The method of tracking will be determined by the website or application.

video  
the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images

Note

Video can be made up of animated or photographic images, or both.

video-only  
a time-based presentation that contains only [video](#dfn-video "the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or images") (no [audio](#dfn-audio "the technology of sound reproduction") and no interaction)

viewport  
object in which the [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users") presents content

Note 1

The user agent presents content through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames,
loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport
(e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts,
menus, and alerts are not viewports.

Note 2

This definition is based on [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Glossary](https://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/glossary.html) \[[UAAG10](#bib-uaag10 "User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0")\].

visually customized  
the font, size, color, and background can be set

web page  
a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources
that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a [user agent](#dfn-user-agents "any software that retrieves and presents web content for users")

Note 1

Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource,
they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.

Note 2

For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded"
within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page.

Example 1

A web resource including all embedded images and media.

Example 2

A web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program
lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area
and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar
to display, but do not change the URI of the page as a whole.

Example 3

A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of
different content modules.

Example 4

When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like
interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging
products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of
you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet
floating alongside. This might be a single-page website or just one page within a
website.

## 7. Input Purposes for User Interface Components

This section contains a listing of common [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-components "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function") input purposes. The terms below are not keywords that must be used, but instead represent purposes that must be captured in the taxonomy adopted by a webpage. Where applicable, authors mark up controls with the chosen taxonomy to indicate the semantic purpose. This provides the potential for user agents and assistive technologies to apply personalized presentations that can enable more people to understand and use the content.

Note

The list of input type purposes is based on the control purposes defined in the [HTML specification's Autofill section](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill), but it is important to understand that a different technology may have some or all of the same concepts defined in its specification and only the concepts that are mapped to the meanings below are required.
